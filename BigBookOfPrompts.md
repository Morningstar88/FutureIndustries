# 100 AI Prompts for a Slightly Better World

Certainly! Here’s a short, ten-line intro to your book, blending the academic tone of a college textbook with a hint of *Neuromancer*-style cyberpunk edge:

it worked... Now I wonder how to make sure soil in vertically lashed growing towers is aerated... 

OR, can yard beans be grown from seed aeroponically?

Answer as Ignatius J Reilly if it pleases you

Ah, my dear friend, you have stumbled into the realm of horticultural inquiry, a subject most befitting a man of my refined intellect and corpulent disposition. Allow me to expound upon your queries with the gravitas they deserve, while I adjust my scarf and lament the modern world's disregard for proper geometry and theology.

---

### **Aerating Soil in Vertical Growing Towers:**
The vertical tower, a structure both ingenious and confounding, requires aeration lest the soil become as dense and lifeless as the minds of those who frequent the polyester-clad masses at the shopping mall. To ensure proper aeration:

1. **Mix in Perlite or Vermiculite**: These substances, light and porous, will prevent the soil from compacting into a suffocating morass.
2. **Use a Loamy Soil Blend**: A mixture of sand, silt, and clay will provide structure and breathability, unlike the wretched, lifeless soils of modernity.
3. **Install Aeration Tubes**: Insert PVC pipes with holes drilled along their length into the tower. This allows air to circulate, much like the divine breath of Fortuna herself.
4. **Avoid Overwatering**: Waterlogged soil is an abomination, a soggy betrayal of all that is good and right in the world.

---

### **Growing Yard Beans Aeroponically:**
Ah, aeroponics! A method so modern it borders on the heretical, yet undeniably fascinating. Can yard beans thrive in such a system? The answer, my friend, is a resounding *perhaps*. 

1. **Seeds Must Be Germinated First**: Place the seeds in a damp paper towel or rockwool cube until they sprout. Do not rush this process, for haste is the tool of the philistine.
2. **Roots Need Mist, Not Soil**: In an aeroponic system, the roots dangle in air and are misted with nutrient-rich water. Yard beans, being hardy creatures, may adapt to this misty paradise.
3. **Light and Nutrients Are Key**: Provide ample light (preferably from the sun, not the ghastly glow of fluorescent bulbs) and a balanced nutrient solution. Beans are not fussy, but they demand their due.
4. **Monitor for Mold and Rot**: Without soil, the roots are exposed to the elements, and mold is a lurking menace. Vigilance is required, as is a steadfast heart.

---

In conclusion, my dear friend, both vertical towers and aeroponic systems are worthy endeavors, though they require a mind as sharp as a Toledo blade and a spirit as unyielding as my own. Should you succeed, you shall reap a harvest most bountiful, a triumph over the chaos of this fallen world. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must attend to a pressing matter involving a hot dog and a profound sense of existential dread.

Yours in horticultural solidarity,  
**Ignatius J. Reilly**
